We didn't implement until conditional. It is completely syntactic sugar for while that we didn't allocate time to implement.

We simplified how comments are done for ease of implementation and 
to enforce prettier code. Comments are just text between two # and 
count as a space (so that they can be placed anywhere except within 
a key word).

To make if's read better we put a comma before the then:
  If <cond>, then <command>.
Implementing if was interesting since an if command is actually two 
separate commands at the AST level.

Any invalid command is a valid label, so the only possible failure 
message that we can give is that a : was expected because the 
improper command looks like a section declaration that is missing a :. 

Throughout we found our internal DSL to be very useful sugar for writing
the interpreter (and tests).
